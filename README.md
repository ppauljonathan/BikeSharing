## General Information
* Background A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
* Business Problem:
    * Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    * How well those variables describe the bike demands
* Dataset used: Bike Sharing data for the years 2018 and 2019, i.e pre pandemic levels

## Conclusions
we can see that the following variables are required for the model
* `hum`
* `windspeed`
* `season_spring`
* `season_winter`
* `yr_2019`
* `mnth_Dec`
* `mth_Sep`
* `weekday_Sat`
* `weathersit_snowy`

## Technologies Used
* `pandas` - 2.2.3
* `numpy` - 2.1.3
* `scipy` - 1.15.2
* `statsmodels` - 0.14.4
* `scikit-learn` - 1.6.1
* `jupyter` - 1.1.1
* `python` - 3.13.2
* `matplotlib` - 3.9.3
* `seaborn` - 0.13.2
